Welcome to my coding blog! This repository contains the source code for my personal coding blog website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main homepage of the coding blog.
- `about.html`: A page providing information about the blog and the author.
- `contact.html`: A page with a contact form and information on how to reach me.
- `pacman.html`: A page where users can play a Pac-Man game.
- `arxiv.html`: A page displaying the latest research papers from arXiv.
- `css/styles.css`: The stylesheet for the website, defining the layout and visual aspects.
- `js/scripts.js`: JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the website.
- `js/pacman.js`: JavaScript file for the Pac-Man game functionality.

## Live Demo

## Future Enhancements

This project is designed to be expandable. Future assignments may include additional content and features, which will be added to the existing structure.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/coding-blog.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd coding-blog
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the homepage.

## Pac-Man Game

The `pacman.html` file includes a playable Pac-Man game. The functionality of the game is implemented in the `js/pacman.js` file. Here is a brief overview of the `pacman.js` file:

- **Game Initialization**: Sets up the game grid, initializes the Pac-Man character, ghosts, and other game elements.
- **Game Loop**: Continuously updates the game state, including movement of Pac-Man and ghosts, collision detection, and score updates.
- **Controls**: Allows the player to control Pac-Man using keyboard inputs (arrow keys).
- **Collision Detection**: Checks for collisions between Pac-Man, ghosts, and walls to determine game outcomes.
- **Scoring**: Tracks the player's score based on the number of pellets eaten and other game events.
- **Game Over**: Handles the game over state, displaying the final score and providing options to restart the game.
