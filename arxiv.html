                <p>  Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer
vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional
segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in
operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The...</p>

                <p>  Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), classified as Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (avian
paramyxovirus type 1), is a promising oncolytic agent that selectively targets

                <p>  The piecewise exponential model is a flexible non-parametric approach for
time-to-event data, but extrapolation beyond final observation times typically
relies on random walk priors and deterministic knot locations, resulting in
unrealistic long-term hazards. We introduce the diffusion piecewise e...</p>

                <p>  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed human cancer in the United
States at present. Early detection is crucial for its successful treatment.
X-ray mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are currently the main
methods for breast cancer screening. However, both have known limitations ...</p>

                <p>  Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination
is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional
manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability...</p>

                <p>  Drug resistance presents a major challenge in cancer therapy. Single cell
profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of
large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data

                <p>  Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be
prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily
via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains

                <p>  Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for prostate cancer
screening. While the genetics of PSA levels has been studied to enhance
screening accuracy, the genetic basis of PSA velocity, the rate of PSA change
over time, remains unclear. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PL...</p>
