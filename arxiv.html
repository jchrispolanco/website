                <h3>Predicting gene essentiality and drug response from perturbation screens
  in preclinical cancer models with LEAP: Layered Ensemble of Autoencoders and
  Predictors</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Bodinier, Gaetan Dissez, Linus Bleistein, Antonin Dauvin</p>
                <p>  Preclinical perturbation screens, where the effects of genetic, chemical, or
environmental perturbations are systematically tested on disease models, hold
significant promise for machine learning-enhanced drug discovery due to their
scale and causal nature. Predictive models can infer perturbation...</p>

                <p>  Pap smear image quality is crucial for cervical cancer detection. This study
introduces an optimized hybrid approach that combines the Perona-Malik
Diffusion (PMD) filter with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) to enhance Pap smear image quality. The PMD filter reduces the im...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Saadat, Jacques Fellay</p>
                <p>  Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional
surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination
codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes.
However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as exist...</p>
