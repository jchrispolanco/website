  regression vs CNNs</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolette Pedersen, Regitze Sydendal, Andreas Wulff, Ralf Raumanns, Eike Petersen, Veronika Cheplygina</p>
                <p>  Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection
of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results
and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis)
of a study on Alzheimer's disease [28] which studied robustness ...</p>

                <p>  Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) as a
new form of internet search for medical information, making it critical to
assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However,
current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searc...</p>

                <p>  Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its
imaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Reconstructing SoS
images from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle
computed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising
model-ba...</p>

and causal utility. Methods and Materials: We used the RADCURE dataset,
consisting of 3,346 patients with H&N cancer treated with definitive

                <p>  In this work the synthesis and characterization of novel gold-nanodiamond

onto the different types of nanodiamond (annealed or annealed and oxidized, 50
or 230 nm) using root extracts of Nympheaea alba as a reducing agen...</p>

                <p>  Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring
molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of
generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns
rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we...</p>

                <p>  Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
and vision tasks, but their application to gene expression analysis remains
limited due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and missing values. We

                <p>  Magnetic particles can be useful in various medical applications, gaining
access to the whole body if deployed in the blood stream. Localised drug
delivery, haemorrhage control and cancer treatment are among the applications
with potential to become revolutionary therapies. Despite this interest, ...</p>

                <p>  The primary objective of phase I cancer clinical trials is to evaluate the
safety of a new experimental treatment and to find the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). We show that the MTD estimation problem can be regarded as a level set

                <p>  Lung cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide, and Vietnam is not
an exception. This disease is the second most common type of cancer globally
and the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, just after liver cancer,
with 23,797 fatal cases and 26,262 new cases, or 14.4% of the di...</p>
