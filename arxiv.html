  Triple-Negative Breast Cancer subtype using Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isabella Cama, Alejandro Guzmán, Cristina Campi, Michele Piana, Karim Lekadir, Sara Garbarino, Oliver Díaz</p>
                <p>  Most papers caution against using predictive models for disease
stratification based on unselected radiomic features, as these features are
affected by contouring variability. Instead, they advocate for the use of the
Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) as a measure of stability for feature
