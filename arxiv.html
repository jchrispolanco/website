                <p>  Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed digital pathology by enabling
biomarker prediction from high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). However,
current methods are computationally inefficient, processing thousands of
redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex aggregator models. We intr...</p>

                <p>  The accelerated failure time model has garnered attention due to its
intuitive linear regression interpretation and has been successfully applied in
fields such as biostatistics, clinical medicine, economics, and social

                <p>  Introduction: The potential for multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests to
detect cancer at earlier stages is currently being evaluated in screening
clinical trials. Once trial evidence becomes available, modelling will be

                <p>  Modern machine learning approaches often prioritize performance at the cost
of increased complexity, computational demands, and reduced interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel framework that challenges this trend by
reinterpreting learning from an information-theoretic perspective, viewing...</p>

                <p>  Cell heterogeneity plays an important role in patient responses to drug
treatments. In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes.
Many modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but
determining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell population...</p>

                <p>  Based on global genomic status, the cancer tumor is classified as
Microsatellite Instable (MSI) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS). Immunotherapy is
used to diagnose MSI, whereas radiation and chemotherapy are used for MSS.
Therefore, it is significant to classify a gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer tumo...</p>

                <p>  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents significant challenges
in clinical oncology due to its heterogeneity and high mortality rates. This

                <p>  The complexities inherent to leukemia, multifaceted cancer affecting white
blood cells, pose considerable diagnostic and treatment challenges, primarily
due to reliance on laborious morphological analyses and expert judgment that
are susceptible to errors. Addressing these challenges, this study p...</p>

                <p>  Recurrent events, characterized by the repeated occurrence of the same event
in an individual, are a common type of data in medical research. Motivated by
cancer recurrences, we aim to estimate the optimal individualized treatment
regime (ITR) that effectively mitigates such recurrent events. An I...</p>
