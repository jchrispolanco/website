                <h3>Domain-Adversarial Neural Network and Explainable AI for Reducing
  Tissue-of-Origin Signal in Pan-cancer Mortality Classification</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristian Padron-Manrique, Juan José Oropeza Valdez, Osbaldo Resendis-Antonio</p>
                <p>  Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring
molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of
generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns
rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Jiang, Saeed Hassanpour</p>
                <p>  Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
and vision tasks, but their application to gene expression analysis remains
limited due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and missing values. We
present GexBERT, a transformer-based autoencoder framework for robust

                <p>  The primary objective of phase I cancer clinical trials is to evaluate the
safety of a new experimental treatment and to find the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). We show that the MTD estimation problem can be regarded as a level set
estimation (LSE) problem whose objective is to determine the region...</p>

                <p>  Lung cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide, and Vietnam is not
an exception. This disease is the second most common type of cancer globally
and the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, just after liver cancer,
with 23,797 fatal cases and 26,262 new cases, or 14.4% of the di...</p>

                <p>  Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose
optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and
healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches
have been developed for this task. The most common mathematical appro...</p>

                <p>  The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can
make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we
developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in
