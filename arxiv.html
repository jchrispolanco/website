                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fardad Vakilipoor, Andreas Ettner-Sitter, Lucas Brand, Sebastian Lotter, Thiha Aung, Silke Harteis, Robert Schober, Maximilian Schäfer</p>
                <p>  Molecular communication (MC) research increasingly focuses on biomedical
applications like health monitoring and drug delivery, demanding testing in
realistic living environments. Elevating MC research requires developing
advanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianjian Yang, Wei Vivian Li</p>
                <p>  Background: The integration and analysis of multi-modal data are increasingly
essential across various domains including bioinformatics. As the volume and
complexity of such data grow, there is a pressing need for computational models
that not only integrate diverse modalities but also leverage th...</p>

                <p>  Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection
of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results
and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis)
of a study on Alzheimer's disease [28] which studied robustness ...</p>

                <p>  Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) as a
new form of internet search for medical information, making it critical to
assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However,
current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searc...</p>

                <p>  Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is
crucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass

                <p>  Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its
imaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Reconstructing SoS
images from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle
computed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising
model-ba...</p>

                <p>  In this work the synthesis and characterization of novel gold-nanodiamond

                <p>  Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring
molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of
generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns
rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we...</p>

                <p>  Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
and vision tasks, but their application to gene expression analysis remains
limited due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and missing values. We
