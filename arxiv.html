                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhonathan Navott, Daniel Jenson, Seth Flaxman, Elizaveta Semenova</p>
                <p>  Recently introduced prior-encoding deep generative models (e.g., PriorVAE,
$\pi$VAE, and PriorCVAE) have emerged as powerful tools for scalable Bayesian
inference by emulating complex stochastic processes like Gaussian processes
(GPs). However, these methods remain largely a proof-of-concept and

                <p>  The treatment of breast cancer using radiotherapy involves uncertainties
regarding breast positioning. As the studies progress, more is known about the
expected breast positioning errors, which are taken into account in the
Planning Target Volume (PTV) in the form of the margin around the clinical...</p>

                <p>  Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an

                <p>  Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality
worldwide. A crucial challenge for early diagnosis is differentiating uncertain
cases with similar visual characteristics and closely annotation scores. In

                <p>  Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift
that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep
learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at

                <p>  We consider two minimal mathematical models for cancer dynamics and
self-adaptation. We aim to capture the interplay between the rapid progression
of cancer growth and the possibility to leverage and enhance self-adaptive
defense mechanisms of an organism, e.g., motivated by immunotherapy. Yet, ou...</p>

                <p>  Identifying immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) studies in genomic repositories

                <p>  The differentiation between pathological subtypes of non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) is an essential step in guiding treatment options and prognosis.
However, current clinical practice relies on multi-step staining and labelling
processes that are time-intensive and costly, requiring highly spe...</p>
