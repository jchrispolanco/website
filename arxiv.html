                <h3>Anomaly-Driven Approach for Enhanced Prostate Cancer Segmentation</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessia Hu, Regina Beets-Tan, Lishan Cai, Eduardo Pooch</p>
                <p>  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying
clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face
challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of
annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which

  Multi-Cancer Early Detection test across and within tumour types and stages</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofia Dias, Yiwen Liu, Stephen Palmer, Marta O Soares</p>
                <p>  The Galleri (R) (GRAIL) multi-cancer early detection test measures
circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to predict the presence of more than 50
different cancers, from a blood test. If sensitivity of the test to detect
early-stage cancers is high, using it as part of a screening programme may lead
to be...</p>

                <p>  Objective: A number of machine learning models have utilized semantic
features, deep features, or both to assess lung nodule malignancy. However,
their reliance on manual annotation during inference, limited interpretability,
and sensitivity to imaging variations hinder their application in real-w...</p>

                <p>  We propose a novel approach to cervical cell image classification for
cervical cancer screening using the EVA-02 transformer model. We developed a
four-step pipeline: fine-tuning EVA-02, feature extraction, selecting important
features through multiple machine learning models, and training a new

                <p>  Recent advances in multi-omics technology highlight the need for statistical

                <p>  This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the
necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of
domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further
domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language

                <p>  Conventional integrated circuits (ICs) struggle to meet the escalating

an unconventional computing paradigm: neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing.
However, current neuromorphic systems face significant challenges in...</p>

                <p>  Colorectal polyps are key indicators for early detection of colorectal
cancer. However, traditional endoscopic imaging often struggles with accurate
polyp localization and lacks comprehensive contextual awareness, which can
limit the explainability of diagnoses. To address these issues, we propose...</p>
