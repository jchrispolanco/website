                <h3>Robust Multimodal Survival Prediction with the Latent Differentiation
  Conditional Variational AutoEncoder</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Zhou, Jiao Tang, Yingli Zuo, Peng Wan, Daoqiang Zhang, Wei Shao</p>
                <p>  The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has
received increasing attention for survival prediction of human cancers.
However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities
are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data i...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirta Dumancic, Guy Heger, Ishai Luz, Maayan Vatarescu, Noam Weizman, Lior Epstein, Tomer Cooks, Lior Arazi</p>
                <p>  Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (Alpha-DaRT) is a new modality
that uses alpha particles to treat solid tumors. Alpha-DaRT employs
interstitial sources loaded with low activities of Radium-224, which release a
chain of short-lived alpha-emitters diffusing over a few millimeters around

                <p>  In this paper, we explore the application of ensemble optimal control to

we focus on moving beyond the classical clinical approach of giving the patient
the maximal tolerated drug dose (MTD), which does not properly ex...</p>

                <p>  Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) is a well-established optical
technique for tissue composition assessment which has been clinically evaluated
for tumour detection to ensure the complete removal of cancerous tissue. While
point-wise assessment has many potential applications, incorporating a...</p>

                <p>  Motivated by the need to analyze continuously updated data sets in the
context of time-to-event modeling, we propose a novel nonparametric approach to
estimate the conditional hazard function given a set of continuous and discrete
predictors. The method is based on a representation of the conditio...</p>

                <p>  Clinical oncology generates vast, unstructured data that often contain
inconsistencies, missing information, and ambiguities, making it difficult to
extract reliable insights for data-driven decision-making. General-purpose
large language models (LLMs) struggle with these challenges due to their l...</p>
