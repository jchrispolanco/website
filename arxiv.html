  breast cancer</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepti Madurai Muthu, Priyanka S, Lalitha Rani N, P. G. Kubendran Amos</p>
                <p>  Reliable quantification of Ki-67, a key proliferation marker in breast
cancer, is essential for molecular subtyping and informed treatment planning.
Conventional approaches, including visual estimation and manual counting,
suffer from interobserver variability and limited reproducibility. This stu...</p>

                <p>  Introduction: In sodium (23Na) MRI, partial volume effects (PVE) are one of
the most common causes of errors in the quantification of tissue sodium
concentration (TSC) in vivo. Advanced image reconstruction algorithms, such as
compressed sensing (CS), have been shown to potentially reduce PVE. The...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingjian Yao, Weiping Lin, Yan He, Zheng Wang, Liangsheng Wang</p>
                <p>  The fine-grained annotations in whole slide images (WSIs) show the boundaries
of various pathological regions. However, generating such detailed annotation
is often costly, whereas the coarse annotations are relatively simpler to
produce. Existing methods for refining coarse annotations often rely...</p>

                <p>  Multimodal learning combining pathology images and genomic sequences enhances
cancer survival analysis but faces clinical implementation barriers due to
limited access to genomic sequencing in under-resourced regions. To enable

                <p>  mRNA technology has revolutionized vaccine development, protein replacement

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mick Gardner, Audrey Billhymer, Rebecca Kamerer, Joanna Schmit, Trevor Park, Julie Nguyen-Edquilang, Rita Miller, Kim A Selting, Michael Oelze</p>
                <p>  Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) characterizes the composition of cells to
distinguish diseased from healthy tissue. QUS can reflect the complexity of the
tumor and detect early lymph node (LN) metastasis ex vivo. The objective in
this study was to gather preliminary QUS and cytokine data from dogs u...</p>

                <p>  Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize anatomical motion is

                <p>  The appropriateness of the Poisson model is frequently challenged when
examining spatial count data marked by unbalanced distributions,
over-dispersion, or under-dispersion. Moreover, traditional parametric models
may inadequately capture the relationships among variables when covariates
display a...</p>

                <p>  Joint estimation of multiple graphical models (i.e., multiple precision
matrices) has emerged as an important topic in statistics. Unlike separate
estimation, joint estimation can leverage shared structural patterns across
multiple graphs to yield more accurate results. In this paper, we present a...</p>
