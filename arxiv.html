  between air pollution, ecosystem degradation, and health disparities and lung
  cancer in Vietnam</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc Hong Tran, Lan Kim Vien, Ngoc-Thao Thi Le</p>
                <p>  Lung cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide, and Vietnam is not
an exception. This disease is the second most common type of cancer globally
and the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, just after liver cancer,
with 23,797 fatal cases and 26,262 new cases, or 14.4% of the di...</p>

                <p>  Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose
optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and
healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches

                <p>  Background Identifying the right cut-off for continuous biomarkers in
clinical trials is important to identify subgroups of patients who are at
