                <h3>Offset geometry for extended field-of-view in multi-contrast and
  multi-scale X-ray microtomography of lung cancer lobectomy specimens</h3>

                <p>  X-ray microtomography is a powerful non-destructive technique allowing 3D
virtual histology of resected human tissue. The achievable imaging
field-of-view, is however limited by the fixed number of detector elements,
enforcing the requirement to sacrifice spatial resolution in order to image

                <p>  The deployment of advanced deep learning models for medical image
segmentation is often constrained by the requirement for extensively annotated
datasets. Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has
become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we

                <p>  Relative survival methodology deals with a competing risks survival model
where the cause of death is unknown. This lack of information occurs regularly
in population-based cancer studies. Non-parametric estimation of the net
survival is possible through the Pohar Perme estimator. Derived similarl...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Tosh, Boyuan Zhang, Wesley Tansey</p>
                <p>  Scientists often need to analyze the samples in a study that responded to
treatment in order to refine their hypotheses and find potential causal drivers
of response. Natural variation in outcomes makes teasing apart responders from
non-responders a statistical inference problem. To handle latent ...</p>

                <p>  Motivation: An adjuvant is a chemical incorporated into vaccines that
enhances their efficacy by improving the immune response. Identifying adjuvant
names from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and
