                <p>  While deep learning methods have shown great promise in improving the
effectiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by detecting suspicious
lesions from trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), they must overcome multiple
simultaneous challenges. There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance,

                <p>  Biomolecular condensates composed of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
are vital for proper cellular function, and their dysfunction is associated
with diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Despite their biological
importance, the precise physical mechanisms underlying condensate...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Saadat, Jacques Fellay</p>
                <p>  Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional
surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination
codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes.
However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as exist...</p>

                <p>  Vision foundation models (VFMs) are pre-trained on extensive image datasets
to learn general representations for diverse types of data. These models can
subsequently be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, significantly
boosting performance across a broad range of applications. However, exist...</p>

                <p>  In recent years, the ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a
novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy
as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues.
However, due to the limitation of number of particles, achievin...</p>
