                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon F. Martina-Perez, Samuel W. S. Johnson, Rebecca M. Crossley, Jennifer C. Kasemeier, Paul M. Kulesa, Ruth E. Baker</p>
                <p>  Cell heterogeneity plays an important role in patient responses to drug
treatments. In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes.
Many modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but
determining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell population...</p>

                <p>  Based on global genomic status, the cancer tumor is classified as
Microsatellite Instable (MSI) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS). Immunotherapy is
used to diagnose MSI, whereas radiation and chemotherapy are used for MSS.
Therefore, it is significant to classify a gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer tumo...</p>

                <p>  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents significant challenges
in clinical oncology due to its heterogeneity and high mortality rates. This

                <p>  The complexities inherent to leukemia, multifaceted cancer affecting white
blood cells, pose considerable diagnostic and treatment challenges, primarily
due to reliance on laborious morphological analyses and expert judgment that
are susceptible to errors. Addressing these challenges, this study p...</p>

                <p>  Recurrent events, characterized by the repeated occurrence of the same event
in an individual, are a common type of data in medical research. Motivated by
cancer recurrences, we aim to estimate the optimal individualized treatment

                <p>  Automated mammography screening plays an important role in early breast

                <p>  X-ray microtomography is a powerful non-destructive technique allowing 3D
virtual histology of resected human tissue. The achievable imaging

                <p>  The deployment of advanced deep learning models for medical image
segmentation is often constrained by the requirement for extensively annotated
datasets. Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has
become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we
