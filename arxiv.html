  Synthetic Data Study</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Zhang, Alexandre Bousse, Laetitia Imbert, Song Xue, Kuangyu Shi, Julien Bert</p>
                <p>  Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a modern strategy in radiation
oncology that aims to administer a potent radiation dose specifically to cancer
cells using cancer-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Accurate radiation dose
estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning,

                <p>  The difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a clinically
meaningful measure to quantify treatment effect in randomized controlled
trials, especially when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold.
Several frequentist methods exist to estimate RMST adjusted for covariates

                <p>  Deep learning has demonstrated great promise in cancer classification from
whole-slide images (WSIs) but remains constrained by the need for extensive
annotations. Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL)
and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this cha...</p>

                <p>  Leveraging multimodal data, particularly the integration of whole-slide
histology images (WSIs) and transcriptomic profiles, holds great promise for
improving cancer survival prediction. However, excessive redundancy in
multimodal data can degrade model performance. In this paper, we propose

                <p>  Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the
strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations
yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition
metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accur...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hortense Doms, Philippe Lambert, Catherine Legrand</p>
                <p>  In cancer clinical trials, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an
important endpoint, providing information about patients' well-being and daily
functioning. However, missing data due to premature dropout can lead to biased
estimates, especially when dropouts are informative. This paper intr...</p>

                <p>  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are crucial biomarkers in liquid biopsy,
offering a noninvasive tool for cancer patient management. However, their
identification remains particularly challenging due to their limited number and
heterogeneity. Labeling samples for contrast limits the generalization o...</p>
