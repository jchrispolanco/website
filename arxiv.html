                <p>  Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential
for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory
accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated
systems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-...</p>

                <p>  Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are

                <p>  Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with
prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and
staging, primarily based on histopathological examination of biopsy tissue
samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. H...</p>
