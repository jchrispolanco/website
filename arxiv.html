                <p>  Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) offers potential for computational
pathology and precision medicine. However, existing CNN and Transformer
struggle to balance segmentation accuracy and speed due to high
spatial-spectral dimensionality. In this study, we leverage Mamba's global
context modelin...</p>
