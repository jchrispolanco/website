                <p>  Joint estimation of multiple graphical models (i.e., multiple precision
matrices) has emerged as an important topic in statistics. Unlike separate
estimation, joint estimation can leverage shared structural patterns across
multiple graphs to yield more accurate results. In this paper, we present a...</p>

                <p>  Histomorphology is crucial in breast cancer diagnosis. However, existing
whole slide image (WSI) classification methods struggle to effectively
incorporate histomorphology information, limiting their ability to capture key
and fine-grained pathological features. To address this limitation, we prop...</p>

                <p>  Breast cancer survival prediction in computational pathology presents a
remarkable challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. For instance, different
regions of the same tumor in the pathology image can show distinct
morphological and molecular characteristics. This makes it difficult to extract

                <p>  Tumor-associated macrophages are a key component that contributes to the
immunosuppressive microenvironment in human cancers. However, therapeutic
targeting of macrophages has been a challenge in clinic due to the limited
understanding of their heterogeneous subpopulations and distinct functions.

                <p>  Prediction tasks in digital pathology are challenging due to the massive size
of whole-slide images (WSIs) and the weak nature of training signals. Advances
in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved
