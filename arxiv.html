                <h3>AI Assisted Cervical Cancer Screening for Cytology Samples in Developing
  Countries</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Love Panta, Suraj Prasai, Karishma Malla Vaidya, Shyam Shrestha, Suresh Manandhar</p>
                <p>  Cervical cancer remains a significant health challenge, with high incidence
and mortality rates, particularly in transitioning countries. Conventional
Liquid-Based Cytology(LBC) is a labor-intensive process, requires expert
pathologists and is highly prone to errors, highlighting the need for more...</p>

                <p>  Conventional integrated circuits (ICs) struggle to meet the escalating
demands of artificial intelligence (AI). This has sparked a renewed interest in
an unconventional computing paradigm: neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing.
However, current neuromorphic systems face significant challenges in...</p>

                <p>  Colorectal polyps are key indicators for early detection of colorectal
cancer. However, traditional endoscopic imaging often struggles with accurate
polyp localization and lacks comprehensive contextual awareness, which can
limit the explainability of diagnoses. To address these issues, we propose...</p>

                <p>  Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is
crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies
have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer
detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Chen, Anne L. Martel</p>
                <p>  Purpose: The scarcity of high-quality curated labeled medical training data

                <p>  Gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of various cancers but is
hindered by the physico-chemical properties of siRNA and needs a suitable

                <p>  Randomization tests are a popular method for testing causal effects in
clinical trials with finite-sample validity. In the presence of heterogeneous
treatment effects, it is often of interest to select a subgroup that benefits
from the treatment, frequently by choosing a cutoff for a continuous bi...</p>
