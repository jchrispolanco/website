                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Chen, Anne L. Martel</p>
                <p>  Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is
crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies
have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer
detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Chen, Anne L. Martel</p>
                <p>  Purpose: The scarcity of high-quality curated labeled medical training data
remains one of the major limitations in applying artificial intelligence (AI)
systems to breast cancer diagnosis. Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass

                <p>  Gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of various cancers but is
hindered by the physico-chemical properties of siRNA and needs a suitable

                <p>  Randomization tests are a popular method for testing causal effects in
clinical trials with finite-sample validity. In the presence of heterogeneous
treatment effects, it is often of interest to select a subgroup that benefits
from the treatment, frequently by choosing a cutoff for a continuous bi...</p>

                <p>  Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, emphasises
the importance of early detection for better patient outcomes. Pulmonary

                <p>  Detecting dependence between variables is a crucial issue in statistical
science. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called label projection
correlation to measure the dependence between numerical and categorical
variables. The proposed correlation does not require any conditions on

  Beyond Short-Range Dependence</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sisheng Liu, Xiaoli Kong</p>
                <p>  In nonparametric regression analysis, errors are possibly correlated in
practice, and neglecting error correlation can undermine most bandwidth
selection methods. When no prior knowledge or parametric form of the
correlation structure is available in the random design setting, this issue has
