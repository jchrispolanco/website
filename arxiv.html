  trials</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghua Shan</p>
                <p>  Tumor response, a binary variable, has historically been the main measure of
antitumor activity for many cancer phase II single-arm trials. Simon two-stage
designs are often used. Sargent et al. proposed a three-outcome trial design in
this setting which requires smaller sample sizes. For many new...</p>

                <p>  Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in
drug response prediction (DRP), yet their ability to generalize across datasets
remains an open question, raising concerns about their real-world

                <p>  The BI_RADS score is a probabilistic reporting tool used by radiologists to
express the level of uncertainty in predicting breast cancer based on some
morphological features in mammography images. There is a significant

                <p>  Multimodal learning that integrates histopathology images and genomic data
holds great promise for cancer survival prediction. However, existing methods
face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in
Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures i...</p>
