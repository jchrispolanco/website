  DNA biomarkers</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartavya Mathur, Shipra Jain, Nisha Bajiya, Nishant Kumar, Gajendra P. S. Raghava</p>
                <p>  Colorectal cancer remains a major global health concern, with early detection
being pivotal for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we leveraged high
throughput methylation profiling of cellfree DNA to identify and validate
diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. The GSE124600 study data were downlo...</p>

                <p>  In complex and low-data domains such as biomedical research, incorporating
background knowledge (BK) graphs, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks, into graph-based machine learning pipelines is a promising research
direction. However, while BK is often assumed to improve model perfor...</p>

                <p>  AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can
deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than

                <p>  Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential
for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory
accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated

                <p>  Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are

                <p>  Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with
prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and
