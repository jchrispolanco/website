  System</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaizhong Deng, Christopher J. Peters, George P. Mylonas, Daniel S. Elson</p>
                <p>  Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) is a well-established optical
technique for tissue composition assessment which has been clinically evaluated
for tumour detection to ensure the complete removal of cancerous tissue. While
point-wise assessment has many potential applications, incorporating a...</p>

                <p>  Objective. This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed
at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical
applications.
  Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three...</p>

                <p>  Motivated by the need to analyze continuously updated data sets in the
context of time-to-event modeling, we propose a novel nonparametric approach to
estimate the conditional hazard function given a set of continuous and discrete
predictors. The method is based on a representation of the conditio...</p>

  Oncology</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morteza Rohanian, Tarun Mehra, Nicola Miglino, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Michael Krauthammer, Andreas Wicki</p>
                <p>  Clinical oncology generates vast, unstructured data that often contain
inconsistencies, missing information, and ambiguities, making it difficult to
extract reliable insights for data-driven decision-making. General-purpose
large language models (LLMs) struggle with these challenges due to their l...</p>

                <p>  There is growing interest in automating surgical tasks using robotic systems,
such as endoscopy for treating gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, previous
studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots,
with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for...</p>

                <p>  Lymph node (LN) assessment is an essential task in the routine radiology
workflow, providing valuable insights for cancer staging, treatment planning
and beyond. Identifying scatteredly-distributed and low-contrast LNs in 3D CT
scans is highly challenging, even for experienced clinicians. Previous...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik J. Thomsen, Johan L. A. Dubbeldam</p>
                <p>  Adaptive therapy is a recent paradigm in cancer treatment aiming at
indefinite, safe containment of the disease when cure is judged unattainable.
In modeling this approach, inherent limitations arise due to the structure of
the vector fields and the bounds imposed by toxic side-effects of the drug...</p>

                <p>  Oxygen concentration in tumor micro-environment is a well-established signal
that can induce aggressive cancer behaviour. In particular, low oxygen levels
(hypoxia) activate the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor(HIF) pathway which has an array
of target systems. One of these systems is Integrin-Linked Kina...</p>

                <p>  We address the common yet often-overlooked selection bias in interventional
studies, where subjects are selectively enrolled into experiments. For
instance, participants in a drug trial are usually patients of the relevant
disease; A/B tests on mobile applications target existing users only, and g...</p>
