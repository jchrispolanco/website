                <h3>Conditional success of adaptive therapy: the role of treatment-pausing
  thresholds revealed by mathematical modeling</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lanfei Sun, Haifeng Zhang, Kai Kang, Xiaoxin Wang, Leyi Zhang, Yanan Cai, Changjing Zhuge, Lei Zhang</p>
                <p>  Adaptive therapy (AT) improves cancer treatment by controlling the
competition between sensitive and resistant cells via treatment holidays. This
study highlights the critical role of treatment-pausing thresholds in AT for
tumors composed of drug-sensitive and resistant cells. Using a Lotka-Volter...</p>

                <p>  Relative survival methodology deals with a competing risks survival model
where the cause of death is unknown. This lack of information occurs regularly
in population-based cancer studies. Non-parametric estimation of the net
survival is possible through the Pohar Perme estimator. Derived similarl...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Tosh, Boyuan Zhang, Wesley Tansey</p>
                <p>  Scientists often need to analyze the samples in a study that responded to
treatment in order to refine their hypotheses and find potential causal drivers
of response. Natural variation in outcomes makes teasing apart responders from
non-responders a statistical inference problem. To handle latent ...</p>

                <p>  Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream
for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and
hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily
depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from th...</p>

                <p>  Cancers are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity and diverse prognosis.
Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and
clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer
diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shift...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony D. Blaom, Samuel Okon</p>
                <p>  A new computational tool TumorGrowth.jl for modeling tumor growth is
introduced. The tool allows the comparison of standard textbook models, such as
General Bertalanffy and Gompertz, with some newer models, including, for the
first time, neural ODE models. As an application, we revisit a human met...</p>
