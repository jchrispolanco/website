                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moka Komaki, Satoru Shinoda, Haiyan Zheng, Kouji Yamamoto</p>
                <p>  It is crucial to design Phase II cancer clinical trials that balance the
efficiency of treatment selection with clinical practicality. Sargent and
Goldberg proposed a frequentist design that allow decision-making even when the
primary endpoint is ambiguous. However, frequentist approaches rely on ...</p>

                <p>  Introduction: Neutrons are produced when photons interact with parts of the
accelerator, materials in the treatment room, or the patient's body. These
neutrons have significant biological effects due to their high quality factor,
potentially leading to secondary cancers. Material and method: A Mon...</p>
