                <p>  Background: Tumour budding is an independent predictor of metastasis and
prognosis in colorectal cancer and is a vital part of the pathology
specification report. In a conventional pathological section observation
process, pathologists have to repeatedly switch from 10x objective to 20x
objective ...</p>

                <p>  To improve the prediction of cancer survival using whole-slide images and
transcriptomics data, it is crucial to capture both modality-shared and
modality-specific information. However, multimodal frameworks often entangle
these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressin...</p>

                <p>  In this study, we focus on estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect
(HTE) for survival outcome. The outcome is subject to censoring and the number
of covariates is high-dimensional. We utilize data from both the randomized
controlled trial (RCT), considered as the gold standard, and real-worl...</p>

                <p>  Gastric cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and has a high
mortality rate. Due to limited medical resources, developing machine learning
models for gastric cancer recognition provides an efficient solution for
medical institutions. However, such models typically require large samp...</p>

                <p>  The heterogeneous treatment effect plays a crucial role in precision
medicine. There is evidence that real-world data, even subject to biases, can
be employed as supplementary evidence for randomized clinical trials to improve
the statistical efficiency of the heterogeneous treatment effect estima...</p>

                <p>  Tumor response, a binary variable, has historically been the main measure of
antitumor activity for many cancer phase II single-arm trials. Simon two-stage
designs are often used. Sargent et al. proposed a three-outcome trial design in
this setting which requires smaller sample sizes. For many new...</p>
