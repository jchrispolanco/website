  Segmentation in PET-CT Images</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Mei, Chenyu Lin, Yu Qiu, Yaonan Wang, Hui Zhang, Ziyang Wang, Dong Dai</p>
                <p>  Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. PET-CT is
crucial for imaging lung tumors, providing essential metabolic and anatomical
information, while it faces challenges such as poor image quality, motion
artifacts, and complex tumor morphology. Deep learning-based models ar...</p>

                <p>  Exposure assessment in occupational epidemiology may involve multiple unknown
quantities that are measured or reconstructed simultaneously for groups of
workers and over several years. Additionally, exposures may be collected using
different assessment strategies, depending on the period of exposu...</p>

                <p>  Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common and fourth most lethal cancer
globally, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%. Despite
extensive research on its pathobiology, the prognostic predictability remains
inadequate, compounded by pathologists' high workload and potential d...</p>

                <p>  To improve the prediction of cancer survival using whole-slide images and
transcriptomics data, it is crucial to capture both modality-shared and
modality-specific information. However, multimodal frameworks often entangle
these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressin...</p>

                <p>  In this study, we focus on estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect
(HTE) for survival outcome. The outcome is subject to censoring and the number
of covariates is high-dimensional. We utilize data from both the randomized
