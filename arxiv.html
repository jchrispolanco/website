                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Gilin, Sanne Laauwen, Yuying Xia, Noria Yousufi, Lu Cao</p>
                <p>  Oxygen concentration in tumor micro-environment is a well-established signal
that can induce aggressive cancer behaviour. In particular, low oxygen levels
(hypoxia) activate the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor(HIF) pathway which has an array
of target systems. One of these systems is Integrin-Linked Kina...</p>

                <p>  We address the common yet often-overlooked selection bias in interventional
studies, where subjects are selectively enrolled into experiments. For
instance, participants in a drug trial are usually patients of the relevant
disease; A/B tests on mobile applications target existing users only, and g...</p>

                <p>  Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive
muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to
reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no
single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators ...</p>

                <p>  In histopathology, intelligent diagnosis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is
essential for automating and objectifying diagnoses, reducing the workload of

                <p>  Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising gene interaction for cancer therapy.
Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural
networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as
explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanis...</p>
