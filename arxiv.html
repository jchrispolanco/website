                <h3>Evaluating the Impact of CT-to-RED Calibration Curves on Dosimetric
  Accuracy in Brain Radiotherapy Dose Distribution</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossam Donya, Duong Thanh Tai, Islam G. Ali</p>
                <p>  Accurate dose calculation is crucial in radiotherapy, as tissue relative
electron densities (RED) derived from CT scans play a vital role. This study
investigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain
cancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS

  single-isocenter radiosurgery</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Sundstr√∂m, Anton Finnson, Elin Hynning, Geert De Kerf, Albin Fredriksson</p>
                <p>  Background: A growing number of cancer patients with brain metastases can
benefit from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) thanks to recent advances in
systemic therapies. With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter
treatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive
optio...</p>

                <p>  Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling
methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the
high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of

                <p>  Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image
analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is
widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection
based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the...</p>

                <p>  This paper highlights a parallel between the forward backward sweeping method
for optimal control and deep learning training procedures. We reformulate a
classical optimal control problem, constrained by a differential equation
system, into an optimization framework that uses neural networks to re...</p>

                <p>  High stakes decision-making often requires a continuous interplay between
evolving evidence and shifting hypotheses, a dynamic that is not well supported
by current AI decision support systems. In this paper, we introduce a
mixed-initiative framework for AI assisted decision making that is grounde...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doanh C. Bui, Hoai Luan Pham, Vu Trung Duong Le, Tuan Hai Vu, Van Duy Tran, Yasuhiko Nakashima</p>
                <p>  Lifelong learning for whole slide images (WSIs) poses the challenge of
training a unified model to perform multiple WSI-related tasks, such as cancer
subtyping and tumor classification, in a distributed, continual fashion. This
is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSI...</p>

                <p>  This chapter introduces evolutionary antifragility as the time-scale
interaction characteristics of a natural dynamic system. It describes the
benefit derived from input distribution unevenness, based on the emergent
system dynamics and its uncertain and volatile interactions with the operating
