  Digital Pathology Workflow</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jai Prakash Veerla, Partha Sai Guttikonda, Helen H. Shang, Mohammad Sadegh Nasr, Cesar Torres, Jacob M. Luber</p>
                <p>  Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases
like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense
scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the
limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces cons...</p>

                <p>  Serious illness communication (SIC) in end-of-life care faces challenges such
as emotional stress, cultural barriers, and balancing hope with honesty.
Despite its importance, one of the few available ways for clinicians to

                <p>  Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a
critical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep
learning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.
Current approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous

                <p>  Pancreatic cancer, which has a low survival rate, is the most intractable one
among all cancers. Most diagnoses of this cancer heavily depend on abdominal
computed tomography (CT) scans. Therefore, pancreas segmentation is crucial but
challenging. Because of the obscure position of the pancreas, s...</p>
