                <p>  The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding
diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide
images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised
pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for d...</p>

                <p>  Background and Objective. With minor differences, most national colorectal
cancer (CRC) screening programs in Europe consist of one-size-fits-all
aged-based strategies. This paper provides a decision analysis-based approach

                <p>  AI models for lung cancer screening are limited by data scarcity, impacting
generalizability and clinical applicability. Generative models address this
issue but are constrained by training data variability. We introduce SYN-LUNGS,
a framework for generating high-quality 3D CT images with detailed...</p>

                <p>  Accurate tumor detection in digital pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) is
crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) has emerged as a widely used approach for weakly-supervised tumor

                <p>  Neuroblastoma is a paediatric extracranial solid cancer that arises from the
developing sympathetic nervous system and is characterised by an abnormal
distribution of cell types in tumours compared to healthy infant tissues. In
this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of cell differentiatio...</p>

                <p>  The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed
histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Saleem, Muhammad Imran Sharif</p>
                <p>  The lungs are the essential organs of respiration, and this system is
significant in the carbon dioxide and exchange between oxygen that occurs in
human life. However, several lung diseases, which include pneumonia,
tuberculosis, COVID-19, and lung cancer, are serious healthiness challenges and

                <p>  Clinical decision-making depends on expert reasoning, which is guided by
standardized, evidence-based guidelines. However, translating these guidelines
into automated clinical decision support systems risks inaccuracy and
importantly, loss of nuance. We share an application architecture, the Large...</p>

                <p>  Cancer is a complex disease driven by dynamic regulatory shifts that cannot
be fully captured by individual molecular profiling. We employ a data-driven
approach to construct a coarse-grained dynamic network model based on hallmark
interactions, integrating stochastic differential equations with g...</p>

                <p>  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining plays a significant role in the
evaluation of diseases such as breast cancer. The H&E-to-IHC transformation
based on generative models provides a simple and cost-effective method for
