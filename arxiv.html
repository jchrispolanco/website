  application on cancer therapy</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjing Zhang, Wandi Ding, Huaiping Zhu</p>
                <p>  This paper highlights a parallel between the forward backward sweeping method
for optimal control and deep learning training procedures. We reformulate a
classical optimal control problem, constrained by a differential equation
system, into an optimization framework that uses neural networks to re...</p>

                <p>  High stakes decision-making often requires a continuous interplay between
evolving evidence and shifting hypotheses, a dynamic that is not well supported
by current AI decision support systems. In this paper, we introduce a
mixed-initiative framework for AI assisted decision making that is grounde...</p>

  Whole-Slide Image Analysis in the Era of Pathology Vision-Language Foundation
  Models?</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doanh C. Bui, Hoai Luan Pham, Vu Trung Duong Le, Tuan Hai Vu, Van Duy Tran, Yasuhiko Nakashima</p>
                <p>  Lifelong learning for whole slide images (WSIs) poses the challenge of
training a unified model to perform multiple WSI-related tasks, such as cancer
subtyping and tumor classification, in a distributed, continual fashion. This
is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSI...</p>

                <p>  This chapter introduces evolutionary antifragility as the time-scale
interaction characteristics of a natural dynamic system. It describes the
benefit derived from input distribution unevenness, based on the emergent
system dynamics and its uncertain and volatile interactions with the operating

                <p>  Objective: Healthcare data fragmentation presents a major challenge for

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaqian Chen, Lin Li, Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Derek L. Nguyen, Allan D. Kirk, Maciej A. Mazurowski, E. Shelley Hwang</p>
                <p>  Mammographic breast density is a well-established risk factor for breast
cancer. Recently there has been interest in breast MRI as an adjunct to
mammography, as this modality provides an orthogonal and highly quantitative
assessment of breast tissue. However, its 3D nature poses analytic challenge...</p>

                <p>  The density of a protein molecule is a key property within a variety of
experimental techniques. We present a computational method for determining
protein mass density that explicitly incorporates hydration effects. Our
approach uses molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the volume of solvent...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navreet Kaur, Manuel Gonzales IV, Cristian Garcia Alcaraz, Jiaqi Gong, Kristen J. Wells, Laura E. Barnes</p>
                <p>  Non-adherence to medications is a critical concern since nearly half of
patients with chronic illnesses do not follow their prescribed medication
regimens, leading to increased mortality, costs, and preventable human
distress. Amongst stage 0-3 breast cancer survivors, adherence to long-term
adjuv...</p>
