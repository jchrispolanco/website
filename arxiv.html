                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leila Bagheriye, Johan Kwisthout</p>
                <p>  Real-time computer-aided diagnosis using artificial intelligence (AI), with
images, can help oncologists diagnose cancer with high accuracy and in an early
phase. We reviewed real-time AI-based analyzed images for decision-making in
different cancer types. This paper provides insights into the pre...</p>

                <p>  Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes
and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible.
As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased,

                <p>  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common and
aggressive types of pancreatic cancer. However, due to the lack of early and
disease-specific symptoms, most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an advanced
disease stage. Consequently, early PDAC detection is crucial for improv...</p>

                <p>  Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality
of life. Mobile diary entries-short text entries recording through their phone

                <p>  The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has

                <p>  Postoperative prognostic prediction for colorectal cancer liver metastasis
(CRLM) remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the
hepatic microenvironment, and insufficient multimodal data fusion. To address
these issues, we propose 4D-ACFNet, the first framework that syne...</p>
