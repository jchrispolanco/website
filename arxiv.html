                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Averly, Frazier N. Baker, Xia Ning</p>
                <p>  Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, relying heavily on
human medicinal chemists, who can spend years searching the vast space of
potential therapies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry
have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, the...</p>

                <p>  In recent years, the ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a
novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy
as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues.
However, due to the limitation of number of particles, achievin...</p>

                <p>  Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed digital pathology by enabling
biomarker prediction from high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). However,
current methods are computationally inefficient, processing thousands of
redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex aggregator models. We intr...</p>

                <p>  The accelerated failure time model has garnered attention due to its
intuitive linear regression interpretation and has been successfully applied in
fields such as biostatistics, clinical medicine, economics, and social
sciences. This paper considers a weighted least squares estimation method with...</p>

                <p>  Introduction: The potential for multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests to
detect cancer at earlier stages is currently being evaluated in screening
clinical trials. Once trial evidence becomes available, modelling will be

                <p>  Amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease caused by the deposition of

                <p>  Modern machine learning approaches often prioritize performance at the cost
of increased complexity, computational demands, and reduced interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel framework that challenges this trend by
reinterpreting learning from an information-theoretic perspective, viewing...</p>

                <p>  Cell heterogeneity plays an important role in patient responses to drug
treatments. In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes.
Many modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but
determining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell population...</p>

                <p>  Based on global genomic status, the cancer tumor is classified as
Microsatellite Instable (MSI) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS). Immunotherapy is
used to diagnose MSI, whereas radiation and chemotherapy are used for MSS.
Therefore, it is significant to classify a gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer tumo...</p>
