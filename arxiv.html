  Whole Slide Image Classification</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangbo Shi, Chen Li, Tieliang Gong, Yefeng Zheng, Huazhu Fu</p>
                <p>  Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream
for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and
hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily
depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from th...</p>
