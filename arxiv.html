                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soon Jynn Chu, Nalaka Amarasiri, Sandesh Giri, Priyata Kafle</p>
                <p>  Type 1 Diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system
attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in
little to no insulin production. Insulin helps glucose in your blood enter your
muscle, fat, and liver cells so they can use it for energy or...</p>

                <p>  Pancreatic NEuroendocrine Tumors (pNETs) are very rare endocrine neoplasms
that account for less than 5% of all pancreatic malignancies, with an incidence
of only 1-1.5 cases per 100,000. Early detection of pNETs is critical for
improving patient survival, but the rarity of pNETs makes segmenting ...</p>

                <p>  Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed
tomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion
during breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed

                <p>  Restricted mean survival time (RMST) offers a compelling nonparametric
alternative to hazard ratios for right-censored time-to-event data,
particularly when the proportional hazards assumption is violated. By capturing
the total event-free time over a specified horizon, RMST provides an intuitive

                <p>  Multiphase CT studies are routinely obtained in clinical practice for
diagnosis and management of various diseases, such as cancer. However, the CT
studies can be acquired with low radiation doses, different scanners, and are
frequently affected by motion and metal artifacts. Prior approaches have...</p>

                <p>  With over 85 million CT scans performed annually in the United States,
creating tumor-related reports is a challenging and time-consuming task for

                <p>  Building trusted datasets is critical for transparent and responsible Medical
AI (MAI) research, but creating even small, high-quality datasets can take

                <p>  Background: Recently, numerous foundation models pretrained on extensive data
have demonstrated efficacy in disease prediction using Electronic Health
Records (EHRs). However, there remains some unanswered questions on how to best
utilize such models especially with very small fine-tuning cohorts....</p>

                <p>  Problem: Pancreas radiological imaging is challenging due to the small size,
blurred boundaries, and variability of shape and position of the organ among
patients. Goal: In this work we present MiniGPT-Pancreas, a Multimodal Large
