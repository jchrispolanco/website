                <p>  Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be
prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily
via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains
a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequen...</p>

                <p>  Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for prostate cancer
screening. While the genetics of PSA levels has been studied to enhance
screening accuracy, the genetic basis of PSA velocity, the rate of PSA change
over time, remains unclear. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PL...</p>

                <p>  Deep learning methods have shown promise in classifying breast cancer
histopathology images, but their performance often declines with limited
annotated data, a critical challenge in medical imaging due to the high cost
