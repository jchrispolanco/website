  trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice Cleynen, Benoîte de Saporta, Amélie Vernay</p>
                <p>  Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a
non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients.
Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations
of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment

                <p>  Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes
and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible.
As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased,

                <p>  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common and
aggressive types of pancreatic cancer. However, due to the lack of early and
disease-specific symptoms, most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an advanced
disease stage. Consequently, early PDAC detection is crucial for improv...</p>

                <p>  The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has
received increasing attention for survival prediction of human cancers.
However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities
are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data i...</p>

                <p>  Postoperative prognostic prediction for colorectal cancer liver metastasis
(CRLM) remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the
hepatic microenvironment, and insufficient multimodal data fusion. To address
these issues, we propose 4D-ACFNet, the first framework that syne...</p>
