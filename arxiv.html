                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Liu, Haosen Yang, Federica Eduati, Josien P. W. Pluim, Mitko Veta</p>
                <p>  Leveraging multimodal data, particularly the integration of whole-slide
histology images (WSIs) and transcriptomic profiles, holds great promise for
improving cancer survival prediction. However, excessive redundancy in
multimodal data can degrade model performance. In this paper, we propose

                <p>  Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the
strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations
yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition
metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accur...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hortense Doms, Philippe Lambert, Catherine Legrand</p>
                <p>  In cancer clinical trials, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an
important endpoint, providing information about patients' well-being and daily
functioning. However, missing data due to premature dropout can lead to biased
estimates, especially when dropouts are informative. This paper intr...</p>

                <p>  In the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), argumentative XAI

                <p>  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are crucial biomarkers in liquid biopsy,
offering a noninvasive tool for cancer patient management. However, their
identification remains particularly challenging due to their limited number and
heterogeneity. Labeling samples for contrast limits the generalization o...</p>

                <p>  Particle Therapy (PT) has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer treatment,

                <p>  Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular
organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical
factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual

                <p>  Organ segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a vital role
in cancer quantification. Low-dose PET (LDPET) provides a safer alternative by
reducing radiation exposure. However, the inherent noise and blurred boundaries
make organ segmentation more challenging. Additionally, existin...</p>

                <p>  We consider the problem of meta-analyzing outcome measures based on median
survival times, such as the difference of median survival times between groups.
Primary studies with time-to-event outcomes often report estimates of median
survival times and corresponding confidence intervals based on the...</p>
