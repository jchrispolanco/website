                <p>  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a
large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image
data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from
unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical ...</p>

                <p>  Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions
while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment

                <p>  Breast cancer (BC) is the most widespread cancer globally, yet current
diagnostic and prognostic methods inadequately capture its biological
complexity, despite the benefits of early detection. Cancer systems biology

                <h3>Spatial Confounding in Multivariate Areal Data Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Lin Wu, Sudipto Banerjee</p>
                <p>  We investigate spatial confounding in the presence of multivariate disease
dependence. In the "analysis model perspective" of spatial confounding, adding
a spatially dependent random effect can lead to significant variance inflation
of the posterior distribution of the fixed effects. The "data gen...</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Li, Hongzhang Zhu, Tao Chen, Xiaohua Qian</p>
                <p>  Recently, numerous pancreas segmentation methods have achieved promising
performance on local single-source datasets. However, these methods don't
adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show
limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources.

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolina Vargas-Ecos, Edwin Salcedo</p>
                <p>  According to the Pan American Health Organization, the number of cancer cases

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Testa, Qi Xu, Jing Lei, Kathryn Roeder</p>
                <p>  In modern scientific applications, large volumes of covariate data are
readily available, while outcome labels are costly, sparse, and often subject
to distribution shift. This asymmetry has spurred interest in semi-supervised
